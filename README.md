The objective of the Visit the World Home edition project is to facilitate access to Liquid Galaxy or a private TV via voice commands, using an independent platform running on a Raspberry Pi4.

The user in this case is intended for the elderly, and can use the platform to send KML to a normal Liquid Galaxy installation connected to the same network, or use this device connected to their TV through an HDMI cable, as a system independent.

This device should be as simple as possible so that the user does not have doubts or difficulties when using it. To turn the device on and off, an easy-to-see and accessible button will be applied, later the idea is that it works as a voice assistance for Liquid Galaxy, it will only receive voice commands and it will not need more information from the user.


Use Cases

1. Liquid Galaxy Installation: 
The device can connect using network information and send commands to Liquid Galaxy with voice commands.

2. Independent installation on TV: 
The device can be connected to the TV, via HDMI connection, and thus the user will see Google Earth on their TV and can 
navigate around the world using voice commands.
